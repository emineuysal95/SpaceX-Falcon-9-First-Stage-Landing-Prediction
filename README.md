ðŸš€ SpaceX-Falcon-9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction Project
This project was completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The goal was to predict the successful landing of SpaceXâ€™s Falcon 9 first-stage boosters using historical launch data and machine learning techniques.

ðŸ“Œ Objective
SpaceX aims to reduce the cost of space travel by reusing rockets. In this project, we build a machine learning model to predict whether a Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land based on features such as rocket type, launch site, payload mass, orbit, and launch date.

ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium
Scikit-learn


ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset combines SpaceX's public launch records and additional metadata. Data was preprocessed, cleaned, and transformed for machine learning tasks.Key variables include:

* Launch Site
* Payload Mass (kg)
* Orbit Type
* Launch Date
* Landing Outcome

ðŸ§  Machine Learning Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations
Feature Engineering: transforming categorical features and creating new predictors
Model Training:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
Model Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and cross-validation

Visualization of predictions and performance comparisons

âœ… Key Results
The Random Forest model performed best in predicting successful landings.

The model provides insights into key factors influencing Falcon 9 recovery success.
